# weatherAPI
Heres the Source Code for a nice Weather App with the Openweathermap api on German. Hope u like it!
In order to make this code work you need to create 3 files in your Directory for the Website you want to create. The first File is gonna be named: index.html ; the second one: style.css ; and the third one: script.js .
After you created all of them, you start copying the codes out of the Files (same name for the same file you created) i uploaded and paste them into your file. After you done all of these steps your Weather App should function perfectly. 
If you got any Questions left you can contact me on here or create an Issue. Im gonna try my best to answer as quick as possible.
And now have a nice day friends!!!
